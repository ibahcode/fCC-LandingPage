# Landing Page

As the First Certificate project, freeCodeCamp assigned me a product I wish to highlight for the Landing Page. 

I choose iPhone SE for this case. In here I will be pointing out the basic Specification along with an external link to more detailed explanation about the phone. To help me accomplish this I have used my Basic HTML and CSS skills from what I learned at [(New) Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).
